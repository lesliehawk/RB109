if false
  greeting = "hello world"
end

# This will return nil because everything in ruby evaluates to true, so the if statement cannot be run and the return is nothing/nil

greeting
# Therefore this will return nil because the variable greeting is initialized and set to nil in the condition

# Is the return of the if statement (nil) what is set as the value for greeting?
# Or is the initialized greeting set to nil independant of the statement return?
